#Chopper Chopper#

Chopper Chopper is a simple Python program that generates a poem from a corpus of text by randomly arranging lines from that text that contain a keyword.

Usage:

    python chopper.py <rozay.txt keyword 7

To use the program, point it toward a corpus of text (the text must already be broken up into discrete lines) and then specify the keyword you want to search for and the number of random lines you want it to return.
